# Introduction

GAMEE is a social platform full of HTML5 games. Our goal is to make the games playable everywhere. You can play in the mobile apps (Android, iOS), bots (Telegram, Kik, Facebook Messenger) or directly on web.

[GAMEE JS](https://github.com/gameeapp/gamee-js) is our Javascript framework for connecting HTML5 game to GAMEE platform.

## Construct Plugins

We developped 2 plugins for C3 and C2 to allow Construct users to integrate our javascript framework without any need to learn any code more than that we have developed an Emulator that helps game designers to create and test games within the Gamee's Construct Plugins. The Emulator is not connected to any backend. It should work as replica of the web platform.

The Emulator Tool is only published on our website, you can use it from [here](https://emulator.gameeapp.com)

# Download
